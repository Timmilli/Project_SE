# Technical expectations
 -    Spatial accuracy and granularity. What is the precision you can create a dot at a given coordinate? What is the minimum size of this dot?
 -    Temporal accuracy and granularity. What is the LEDs refreshing frequency ? What is the granularity you can reach to measure the boards's rotation duration?
 -    What is the board's rotating speed? Quantify its stability
 -    Time estimation accuracy. If you start with a perfect time, how much will it drift after 6 month of use?
 -    Code efficiency. What is the cost (in time and in number of cycles) of your interrupts? Of a floating multiplication and division? Of an integer multiplication and division?
 -    How much memory do you use? How much is left? What are different types of memory available and what are they used for?
